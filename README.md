# Startup-Data-EDA
Project Overview

This project is the first I completed as part of my Data Science course, where I applied foundational skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze startup data.This project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into startup data, helping to identify key trends, patterns, and potential success factors. The goal is to understand and visualize data features that might influence startup performance and growth.

Project Structure

Data Collection: Information on data sources or dataset features.

Data Cleaning: Removing Unnecessary columns,changing data type of columns,etc

Exploratory Data Analysis: A breakdown of various EDA techniques used, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights drawn from the data.

Key Findings: Summary of insights that may benefit startup-related decision-making.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

Installation

https://github.com/AimanSabaha/Startup-Data-EDA.git

cd Startup-data-analysis-using-exploratory-data-analysis

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1 Load the dataset.

2 Run the notebooks to visualize different analyses.

3 Interpret the visualizations to gain insights.
