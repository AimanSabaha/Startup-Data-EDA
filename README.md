# Startup-Data-EDA
Project Overview

This project is the first I completed as part of my Data Science course, where I applied foundational skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze startup data.This project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into startup data, helping to identify key trends, patterns, and potential success factors. The goal is to understand and visualize data features that might influence startup performance and growth.

Project Structure

Data Collection: Information on data sources or dataset features.

Data Cleaning: Steps taken to handle missing values, outliers, and other preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis: A breakdown of various EDA techniques used, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights drawn from the data.

Key Findings: Summary of insights that may benefit startup-related decision-making.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
